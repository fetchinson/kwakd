Basic installation
==================

    ./configure
    make
    make install

    You may want to use the file kwakd.init or 
    kwakd.service for automatically 
    starting/stopping/restarting kwakd as a service. 
    Copy it to the appropriate location for your 
    distribution and modify it if the default 
    port 80 is not what you want.

Fancy installation
==================

    ./configure --help
